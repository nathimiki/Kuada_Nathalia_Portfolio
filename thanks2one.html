    <h1>The Project</h1>
    <h2>College Assignment: Final Integrated Project</h2>
    <p class="js-animation">The main objective of this project was for each team to pitch, design and develop a professional advertising campaign and website for the Organ Donation Project. The goal of this project is to encourage all Ontarians to become registered organ and tissue donors and educate them on the impact of their generous decision to give.</p>

    <h1>The Brand</h1>
    <p class="js-animation">Our concept is based on fictional donors who died and saved one or more lives through organ donation. The idea is to create an emotional appealing and maybe create a wake-up call for people to understand how important is to become an Organ Donor and how this could be a life changing oportunity for a lot of people.</p>

    <h1>The Name and Logo</h1>
    <p class="js-animation">We wanted to create an innovative design for this Organ Donation Campaign, something different from any other Organ Donation Campaign. Usually the main color used for the branding of this kind of campaing is red; we decided for a light green because it represents life and in the end our brand focus on saving lives. Our first idea for the name was "Life Goes On", in the process of our concept we created our banner and a tagline that was "Lives goes on thanks to one". After our first checkpoint with our professors, we decided that Thanks To One had a lot of potential, and that's how "Thanks2One" was created. We had 2 versions of "Thanks2One", the first one was a little more clean but it wasn't clear for everybody that the name was "Thanks2One", it could be ready as "ThanksZone". For that reason, our final logo the number 2 is colorful and bigger. In the end, it fitted perfectly to our website and advertisement material.</p>

    <h1>The Maketing Plan</h1>
    <p class="js-animation">Our marketing plan consists in Events, Guerilla Marketing, TV Commercial, Social Media, Influencer Marketing and Stickers. The first event would be placed in London, ON. The idea is to be an interactive event, with a lot of entertainment to bring awareness for the campaign which is very serious and important, but at the same time we want to bring a fun and social atmosphere. To archive that we would have live music, food trucks, graffiti & street art, donation lectures and the most important our "Thanks2One" Truck Registration. The Truck Registration is a Glass Display Truck that features a mobile registation section. The idea is to drive it through the Province and park it strategically at spots like events or shopping malls parking lot.</p>

    <h1>The Result</h1>
    <p class="js-animation projectBox last_p">The biggest challenge of this assignment was to create the marketing plan. It was an extensive research process, to understand which marketing direction would be more appropriate for this kind of campaign. At the same time, we worked to find new ways to spread our message. The Registration Truck was an innovative idea and it has a great potential to increase the Organ Donation Registation Rate.</p>
